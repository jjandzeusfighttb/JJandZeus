							The next day Danaher shut down their main phone lines, and both #PeopleOverProfits and #TimeFor5 trended on social media multiple times throughout the next week.

							<a href="https://twitter.com/JNJNews/status/1679168314986094592" target="_blank">Johnson &amp; Johnson responds publicly to the #PeopleOverProfits campaign</a> with a statement on Twitter that reads, in part: "It is false to suggest—as some recently have—that our patents are being used to prevent access to SIRTURO® (bedaquiline), our medicine for MDR-TB." Their statement touts J&amp;J's work in developing and donating TB-related treatments, and admits that the lack of testing is the highest barrier to treatment.
						</p>
						<p>
							TBFighters respond, in part, with the small impact that Johnson &amp; Johnson's 600,000 courses of bedaquiline over 10 years has had on the 32 million people who died from TB during that time frame. "It is false to suggest—as some recently have—" becomes a meme and rallying cry fro TBFighters.

						</p>

							TBFighters flood Johnson &amp; Johnson's phone lines, emails, and social media to adhere to their credo: "Our first responsibility to to the patients." This also marks the creation of the #PeopleOverProfits hashtag and message, which trends on several platforms over the next few days.
