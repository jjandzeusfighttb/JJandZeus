This builds upon their previous agreement with the Stop TB Partnership (see July 13), which allowed for generic bedaquiline in 44 countries, and <strong>fulfills the initial ask of the #PeopleOverProfits hashtag campaign</strong>.

							<strong>The first phase of the TBFighters campaign</strong> to reduce GenExpert TB test cartridge prices went live starting with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSC06P9A5W4" target="_blank">video from John Green</a>. People were encouraged to send emails, letters, phone calls, and post on social media about the TimeFor5 campaign.
						</p>
						<p>
							The next day Danaher shut down their main phone lines, and both #PeopleOverProfits and #TimeFor5 trended on social media multiple times throughout the next week.

							<strong>John Green introduces Nerdfighteria to GeneXpert catridges</strong> and the MSF "Time for 5" campaign in the first of a series of livestreams.

							Over the next 13 days Nerdfighteria groups got together to find an outstanding amount of information on Danaher, Cepheid, and the products they produce and organize a cohesive plan to make the case for lower prices of Xpert MTB/RIF and MTB/XDR tests.

						<p>
							<a href="https://twitter.com/JNJNews/status/1679168314986094592" target="_blank">Johnson &amp; Johnson responds publicly to the #PeopleOverProfits campaign</a> with a statement on Twitter that reads, in part: "It is false to suggest—as some recently have—that our patents are being used to prevent access to SIRTURO® (bedaquiline), our medicine for MDR-TB." Their statement touts J&amp;J's work in developing and donating TB-related treatments, and admits that the lack of testing is the highest barrier to treatment.
						</p>
						<p>
							TBFighters respond, in part, with the small impact that Johnson &amp; Johnson's 600,000 courses of bedaquiline over 10 years has had on the 32 million people who died from TB during that time frame. "It is false to suggest—as some recently have—" becomes a meme and rallying cry fro TBFighters.

							<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMhgw5SW0h4" target="_blank">John Green announces an effort to ask Johnson &amp; Johnson allow their patents on bedaquiline to lapse</a> without enforcing secondary patents, at least in countries with a high tuberculosis burden or are considered low- and middle-income countries.
						</p>
						<p>
							TBFighters flood Johnson &amp; Johnson's phone lines, emails, and social media to adhere to their credo: "Our first responsibility to to the patients." This also marks the creation of the #PeopleOverProfits hashtag and message, which trends on several platforms over the next few days.
